Hi, I’m Sm Madhavan 👋  
I’m a final-year CSE (AI & ML) undergraduate, currently focused on building strong fundamentals and working on practical projects.

### Currently focused on
- Strengthening Python and core programming fundamentals  
- Building small, consistent projects to develop good GitHub habits  
- Exploring AI/ML concepts through hands-on practice  

### Learning & working with
- Python  
- Basics of Machine Learning and NLP  
- Git & GitHub  
- Problem-solving and code organization  

### How I use GitHub
- To track my learning and coding progress  
- To build consistency through regular commits  
- To gradually work towards open-source contributions  

I believe steady progress and clear fundamentals matter more than rushing ahead, and I’m documenting that journey here.
